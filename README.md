# Getting Started

This is work in production of small project combining Gantt chart theory with some basic financial calculations.

At the moment it is based on Bryntum (https://bryntum.com/) Gantt chart and their tutorial published in Medium.com (https://medium.com/bryntum/creating-a-gantt-chart-with-react-using-next-js-fc080ad8b938).

It also uses Xarrow react library for arrows. Not fully utilized at the moment as there are some issues with rendering.

Work to do:
- At the moment this project is using mockup data. No backend connected. That must be solved at the later stage. I consider using tanstack query library. I will see how it goes. (https://tanstack.com/query/latest)
- No data calculation done - to be added.
- Some logic of adding/removing tasks must be added.
